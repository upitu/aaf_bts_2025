# This is a basic configuration file for serving a React SPA with Nginx.

# Define the server block
server {
    # Listen on port 80, the standard HTTP port
    listen 80;

    # Set the root directory where your built React app is located
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    # This is the main entry point for your app
    index index.html;

    # This block handles all requests
    location / {
        # This is the magic line for SPAs.
        # It tells Nginx to first try to find a file that matches the request URI ($uri).
        # If it can't, it tries to find a directory ($uri/).
        # If that also fails, it falls back to serving the /index.html file.
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
